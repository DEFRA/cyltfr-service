# Check Your Long Term Flood Risk Services (cyltfr-service)

# v6.0.0

## Release date 26 March 2025

### Compatability changes and data updates

The `radius` parameter from the `getByCoordinates` call has been removed as it is no longer needed.

Data definitions stored in the definitions directory have been changed to match with the definitions in 
the `cyltfr-app` service. This is just for consistancy across the code bases.
